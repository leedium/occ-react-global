### Installation

1.  Install the global library through the OCC admin extensions via settings menu.  
*You may need to comment out the code first as the OCC linter doesn't like the additional require.js configuration options.

2. DCU grab and then update the js file with the source.

3. DCU push the changes.

Use this with [occ-react-component](https://github.com/leedium/occ-react-component "Standalone react components for Oracle Commerce Cloud") to create standalone react application in companion with your current native knockout/jquery components.
